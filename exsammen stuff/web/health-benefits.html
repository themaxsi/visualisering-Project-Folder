                <img src="../img/health-benefits-01.jpg">

                <p>
                    Dark chocolate is loaded with nutrients that can positively affect your health.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Made from the seed of the cocoa tree, it is one of the best sources of antioxidants on the planet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Studies show that dark chocolate (not the sugary crap) can improve your health and lower the risk of heart disease.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This article reviews 7 health benefits of dark chocolate or cocoa that are supported by science.
                </p>

                <h2>1. Very Nutritious</h2>

                <p>
                    If you buy quality dark chocolate with a high cocoa content, then it is actually quite nutritious.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It contains a decent amount of soluble fiber and is loaded with minerals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A 100-gram bar of dark chocolate with 70-85% cocoa contains :
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>11 grams of fiber</li>
                    <li>67% of the RDI for iron</li>
                    <li>58% of the RDI for magnesium</li>
                    <li>89% of the RDI for copper</li>
                    <li>98% of the RDI for manganese</li>
                    <li>It also has plenty of potassium, phosphorus, zinc and selenium</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Of course, 100 grams (3.5 ounces) is a fairly large amount and not something you should be consuming daily. All these nutrients also come with 600 calories and moderate amounts of sugar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this reason, dark chocolate is best consumed in moderation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The fatty acid profile of cocoa and dark chocolate is also excellent. The fats are mostly saturated and monounsaturated, with small amounts of polyunsaturated fat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It also contains stimulants like caffeine and theobromine, but is unlikely to keep you awake at night as the amount of caffeine is very small compared to coffee.
                </p>

                <h3>SUMMARY</h3>

                <p>
                    Quality dark chocolate is rich in fiber, iron, magnesium, copper, manganese and a few other minerals.
                </p>

                <h2>2. Powerful Source of Antioxidants</h2>

                <p>
                    ORAC stands for "oxygen radical absorbance capacity." It is a measure of the antioxidant activity of foods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Basically, researchers set a bunch of free radicals (bad) against a sample of a food and see how well the antioxidants in the food can "disarm" the radicals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The biological relevance of ORAC values is questioned, because it's measured in a test tube and may not have the same effect in the body.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, it is worth mentioning that raw, unprocessed cocoa beans are among the highest-scoring foods that have been tested.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dark chocolate is loaded with organic compounds that are biologically active and function as antioxidants. These include polyphenols, flavanols and catechins, among others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One study showed that cocoa and dark chocolate had more antioxidant activity, polyphenols and flavanols than any other fruits tested, which included blueberries and acai berries
                </p>

                <h3>SUMMARY</h3>

                <p>
                    Cocoa and dark chocolate have a wide variety of powerful antioxidants. In fact, they have way more than most other foods.
                </p>

                <h2>3. May Improve Blood Flow and Lower Blood Pressure</h2>

                <p>
                    The flavanols in dark chocolate can stimulate the endothelium, the lining of arteries, to produce nitric oxide (NO).
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the functions of NO is to send signals to the arteries to relax, which lowers the resistance to blood flow and therefore reduces blood pressure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many controlled studies show that cocoa and dark chocolate can improve blood flow and lower blood pressure, though the effects are usually mild.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, one study in people with high blood pressure showed no effect, so take all this with a grain of salt.
                </p>

                <h3>SUMMARY</h3>

                <p>
                    The bioactive compounds in cocoa may improve blood flow in the arteries and cause a small but statistically significant decrease in blood pressure.
                </p>

                <h2>4. Raises HDL and Protects LDL From Oxidation</h2>

                <p>
                    Consuming dark chocolate can improve several important risk factors for heart disease.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a controlled study, cocoa powder was found to significantly decrease oxidized LDL cholesterol in men. It also increased HDL and lowered total LDL for those with high cholesterol.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Oxidized LDL means that the LDL ("bad" cholesterol) has reacted with free radicals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This makes the LDL particle itself reactive and capable of damaging other tissues, such as the lining of the arteries in your heart.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It makes perfect sense that cocoa lowers oxidized LDL. It contains an abundance of powerful antioxidants that do make it into the bloodstream and protect lipoproteins against oxidative damage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dark chocolate can also reduce insulin resistance, which is another common risk factor for many diseases like heart disease and diabetes.
                </p>

                <h3>SUMMARY</h3>

                <p>
                    Dark chocolate improves several important risk factors for disease. It lowers the susceptibility of LDL to oxidative damage while increasing HDL and improving insulin sensitivity.
                </p>

                <h2>5. May Reduce Heart Disease Risk</h2>

                <p>
                    The compounds in dark chocolate appear to be highly protective against the oxidation of LDL.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the long term, this should cause much less cholesterol to lodge in the arteries, resulting in a lower risk of heart disease.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In fact, several long-term observational studies show a fairly drastic improvement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a study of 470 elderly men, cocoa was found to reduce the risk of death from heart disease by a whopping 50% over a 15 year period.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another study revealed that eating chocolate two or more times per week lowered the risk of having calcified plaque in the arteries by 32%. Eating chocolate less frequently had no effect.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yet another study showed that eating dark chocolate more than 5 times per week lowered the risk of heart disease by 57%.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course, these three studies are observational studies, so can't prove that it was the chocolate that reduced the risk.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, since the biological process is known (lower blood pressure and oxidized LDL), it is plausible that regularly eating dark chocolate may reduce the risk of heart disease.
                </p>

                <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
                <p>
                    Observational studies show a drastic reduction in heart disease risk among those who consume the most chocolate.
                </p>

                <h2>6. May Protect Your Skin From the Sun</h2>

                <p>
                    The bioactive compounds in dark chocolate may also be great for your skin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The flavonols can protect against sun damage, improve blood flow to the skin and increase skin density and hydration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The minimal erythemal dose (MED) is the minimum amount of UVB rays required to cause redness in the skin 24 hours after exposure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In one study of 30 people, the MED more than doubled after consuming dark chocolate high in flavanols for 12 weeks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you're planning a beach vacation, consider loading up on dark chocolate in the prior weeks and months.
                </p>

                <h3>SUMMARY</h3>

                <img src="../img/health-benefits-05.jpg">

                <p>
                    Studies show that the flavanols from cocoa can improve blood flow to the skin and protect it from sun damage.
                </p>

                <h2>7. Could Improve Brain Function</h2>

                <p>
                    The good news isn't over yet. Dark chocolate may also improve the function of your brain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One study of healthy volunteers showed that eating high-flavanol cocoa for five days improved blood flow to the brain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cocoa may also significantly improve cognitive function in elderly people with mental impairment. It may improve verbal fluency and several risk factors for disease, as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, cocoa contains stimulant substances like caffeine and theobromine, which may be a key reason why it can improve brain function in the short term.
                </p>

                <h3>SUMMARY</h3>

                <p>
                    Cocoa or dark chocolate may improve brain function by increasing blood flow. It also contains stimulants like caffeine and theobromine.
                </p>
                
                <h2>The bottom line</h2>

                <p>
                    There is considerable evidence that cocoa can provide powerful health benefits, being especially protective against heart disease.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course, this doesn't mean you should go all out and consume lots of chocolate every day. It is still loaded with calories and easy to overeat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Maybe have a square or two after dinner and try to really savor them. If you want the benefits of cocoa without the calories in chocolate, consider making a hot cocoa without any cream or sugar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also be aware that a lot of the chocolate on the market is not healthy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Choose quality stuff — dark chocolate with 70% or higher cocoa content. You might want to check out this guide on how to find the best dark chocolate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dark chocolates typically contain some sugar, but the amounts are usually small and the darker the chocolate, the less sugar it will contain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Chocolate is one of the few foods that taste awesome while providing significant health benefits.
